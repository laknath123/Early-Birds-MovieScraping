# Early-Birds-MovieScraping
 There is no time like a pandemic to watch every single movie in the IMDB database. Our program allows users to filter through a database of movies, using key identifiers like title, genre, and ratings. The program also offers a recommendation feature based on the user’s favorite movie. This program generates pandas dataframes from csv files containing over 100,000 user ratings on over 1,700 movies. Using sqlite3 the program also builds a database to store this information in 3 separate tables. Users can query this database based on their preferences or can simply provide their favorite movie in order to get recommendations. Here the program uses scipy sparse matrices and sci kit learn nearest neighbor modules to build a k- nearest neighbor classifier that identifies and returns a specified number of recommendations. Users can also access additional information about many films. The program uses the Open Movie Database API to obtain plot summaries and movie posters. The program also accesses box office statistics and information about a movie’s cast using web scraping from IMDB.
